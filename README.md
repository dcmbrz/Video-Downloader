This Python script allows users to download a YouTube video by providing its URL and selecting a location to save the downloaded video. Here's how it works:

It imports the YouTube class from the pytube module for downloading YouTube videos, and it imports tkinter for creating the file dialog.

It defines a function download_video(url, save_path) that takes a YouTube video URL and a save path as input. Inside the function, it creates a YouTube object with the provided URL, filters available streams by file extension ('mp4') and whether they are progressive, gets the highest resolution stream, and downloads it to the specified output path.

It defines a function open_file_dialog() that opens a file dialog for the user to select a folder. If a folder is selected, it returns the folder path; otherwise, it returns None.
In the main block:
It creates a Tkinter root window (tk.Tk()) and hides it immediately (root.withdraw()).
It prompts the user to enter a YouTube URL (video_url) and calls the open_file_dialog() function to select a save location (save_dir).
If a save location is selected (save_dir is not None), it initiates the download by calling the download_video() function with the provided URL and save location. Otherwise, it prints "Invalid save location."

This script provides a simple command-line interface for downloading YouTube videos and selecting the save location through a file dialog.
